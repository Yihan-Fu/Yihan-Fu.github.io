# Welcome!

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, under the supervision of [Prof. Bonan Yan](https://bonany.cc). He received B.S.E in Microelectronics from the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, in 2023.

My research interests lie in computer architecture, including probabilistic machine learning (ProbabilisticML) acceleration, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) acceleration, in-memory computing circuits and architectures, and emerging material- or structure-based memory and associated architectures.
